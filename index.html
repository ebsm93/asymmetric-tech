                <h3>The Business Card Renaissance</h3>
                Gone are the days where a couple lines of text and numbers were all you could fit into a business card.
                Now your business card can be a digital asset to both you and your customers.<br>
                Leveraging the power of QR codes we can help your clients find your social media pages or websites faster,
                and also take them straight to a landing page (like this one) or any type of customizable web page of your choosing; be it a pricing menu, a resume or a portfolio of your work.<br>
                This where we, Asymmetric Technologies, come in.<br>
                We do not just make a business card and slap a QR Code onto it -
                we set you up with any number and type of custom web pages to suit your
                business and marketing needs.<br>
                All our QR Codes are powered and secured by <a href="https://www.qrcode-tiger.com/">QR Tiger,</a>
