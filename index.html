                <h3>The Business Card Renaissance</h3>
                Gone are the days where a couple lines of text and numbers were all you could fit into a business card.
                Now your business card can be a digital asset to both you and your customers.<br>
                Leveraging the power of QR codes we can help your clients find your social media pages or websites faster,
                and also take them straight to a landing page (like this one) or any type of customizable web page of your choosing; be it a pricing menu, a resume or a portfolio of your work.<br>
                This where we, Asymmetric Technologies, come in.<br>
                We do not just make a business card and slap a QR Code onto it -
                we set you up with any number and type of custom web pages to suit your
                business and marketing needs.<br>
                All our QR Codes are powered and secured by <a href="https://www.qrcode-tiger.com/">QR Tiger,</a>

            <h2>Think of it</h2>
            <p>
                Technology has a way of becoming very complex, very quickly.
                <br>Technology is supposed to make our lives simpler, yet more dynamic. 
                <br>Unfortunately in many cases it has made our lives more convuluted and difficult. 
                <br>This is where we hope to come in and give your business the benefits of simple, dynamic tech at a very reasonable
                cost. 
                <br>People know "digital presence" is necessary for most if not all businesses. With changing times though, a typical website
                has become a thing people just pay to have without much benefit other than saying you have one. 
                <br>We are offering you something better - a web page or two, not a whole web site, that serves as both a digital extension
                of your business card as well as simple yet creative marketing that suits your industry. 
                <br>One or two webpages people will visit and actually use, rather than a whole website only your mother might visit... once. 
                <br> All this, from a local business with local people who know your area well and who you can meet with over coffee - not just some lad half a world away who you only
                ever email. 
                <br>Make your mama proud, buy our cards!

            <p class="bio section">
                Born in Guatemala, raised in San Francisco CA, my full name is Hebert Alexander Moran Sandoval and I am here to serve.
                <br> I started Asymmetric Technologies in the early spring of 2022 while studying web development using <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>
                as my guide. Once I was approaching the end of the mobile responsive design section I made myself some business cards
                to prepare to look for  work as a webdev. While making these cards along with their digital components I realized how cool these were and that I could do
                this for others at a reasonable cost. After making a couple sets for some friends and family I quickly saw that
                there was an opportunity to bring these to market.
                <br>If you are interested in working with me, feel free to email me.
